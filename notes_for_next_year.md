#broad changes to make
This would be smoother next time if we
- Skip aligning with clustal and instead give students the aligned fasta files. We didn't have enough time to go into why alignment was important or how it worked, so I'm not sure how useful it was.
- Spend more time on basic evolutionary biology and the intuition behind dN/dS on day 1
- Be more careful with terms. Positive and negative selection were a bit counterintuitive, so try to frame in more specific terms.
- Spend more time reviewing unix and dn/ds at the beginning of day 2.

We should make sure to introduce the following concepts in python instruction:
- Writing a for loop that loops through the indexes of a list instead of the items in the list i.e. for i in range(0, len(myList): print(myList[i])
- Counting the number of list items that meet a certain condition by setting a variable to 0 and then adding to it within the for loop if the condition is met.
- Interpreting error messages
- Nesting loops within eachother (or at least tell them that it's possible).
