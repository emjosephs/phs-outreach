#broad changes to make
This would be smoother next time if we
- Skip aligning with clustal and instead give students the aligned fasta files. We didn't have enough time to go into why alignment was important or how it worked, so I'm not sure how useful it was.
- Spend more time on basic evolutionary biology and the intuition behind dN/dS
- Be more careful with terms. Positive and negative selection were a bit counterintuitive, so try to frame in more specific terms.
- Spend more time reviewing at the beginning of day 2.
